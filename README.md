This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision for facial recognition to assist in the early detection of autism in children. The system processes facial features to make predictions regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on provided data. The primary goal is to contribute to the development of innovative tools for early autism detection.

Machine Learning Model: InceptionResnetV1 adaptation called facenet, developed by timesler. Available in the following: https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch
Data Processing: Utilizes data from Kaggle Autism repository by mm909. Available in the following: https://github.com/mm909/Kaggle-Autism
